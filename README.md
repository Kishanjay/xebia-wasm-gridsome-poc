# About
Proof-Of-Concept application using Gridsome, WASM (assemblyscript) & TailwindCSS

With this POC we show a running example using Gridsome as a static site generator
in combination with assemblyscript as a WASM powered computer.

We demonstrate with this application how WASM can potentially speed up your
application on the client-side by comparing native JavaScript vs WASM.

# Dev

`yarn asbuild`

# Prod
